## Objective
Comprehensive study and analysis of machine learning techniques that can be used in enhancing security for cloud computing systems dealing with intrusion detection and its components.
 
> Comprehensive study and analysis of various machine learning techniques for Intrusion Detection System to enhance Cloud security
 
## Motivation
Cloud security demands a wide-ranging strategy â€“ one that takes in both internal and external network infrastructures, and views them as a single ecosystem. With the rise in organizations shifting their work to Cloud environment, there is an initial increase in Attack Surface.In-order to address major possible threats to these attack surface, it is imperative that we use a highly responsive and automated approach to security. This is where Machine Learning comes in, to devise a mechanism for providing a holistic approach to cloud security. 

 
## Scope

Extent of our paper

- Botnets
- Malware Attacks
- Denial-of-Service
- Intrusion Detection and Prevention System

Any type of intrusion / unwanted traffic in the system could prove fatal. These intrusion can range from a Malware attacks, Botnets, DoS Attack, etc. In this paper we will be addressing various machine learning techniques to thwart such unwanted traffic. These unwarranted traffic can be detected and prevented using Intrusion Detection and Prevention System.
 
## Expected Major Results
 
- Survey existing major cloud security issues, threats and attacks
- Literature review (broad scope analysis) of current state-of-the-art ML solutions/techniques for IDS, with real-life exmaples.
- Compare and Contrast academic and current industry standards regarding cloud security.
